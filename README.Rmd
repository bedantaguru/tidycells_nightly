## TL;DR 
Given a `file_name` which is a path of a file that contains table(s). Run this `read_cells()` in the R-console to see whether support is present for the file type. If support is present, just run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_cells(file_name)
```
**Note** Just start with a small file.

## Introduction
The package provides utilities to read, cells from complex tabular data and heuristic detection based 'structural assignment' of those cells to a columnar or tidy format. 

Read functionality has the ability to read (in a unified manner) structured, partially structured or unstructured tabular data (usually spreadsheets for public data dissemination and aimed for common human understanding) from various types of documents. The tabular information is read as cells.
The 'structure assignment' functionality has both supervised and unsupervised way of assigning cells data to columnar/tidy format. Multiple disconnected blocks of tables in a single sheet are also handled appropriately.

These tools are suitable for unattended conversation of (maybe a pile of) messy tables (like government data) into a consumable format(usable for further analysis and data wrangling).

## Inspiration
A spreadsheet is really flexible in storing and sharing data. Many organizations use excel files as their fundamental medium of data exchange (particularly in the government sector). These data are generally not in tidy format (thanks to ultra flexibility of spreadsheets!). 

This is a great time killer for R data scientist adopting [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) techniques. A lot of time is spent to bring the data into a consumable or usable format ([tidy format](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)). 

For example, you may check out [Database of Indian Economy](https://dbie.rbi.org.in/) (a public data dissemination platform from [_Reserve Bank of India_](https://www.rbi.org.in/)). This platform is a great source of Indian economy data. However, since the target audience of this platform is possibly common people and not data scientists, the data structure is not suitable for ready consumption in _tidyverse_ functions. This is not only one, but there are plenty of great source of data which provides data in _"eye-relaxing"_ format rather than tidy format.

Thanks to great packages like [tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr), [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl), [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) (and many other sweet packages mentioned in _reference_) which enable users to spend less time in reshaping the data and focus more on analysis rather than data wrangling.

These packages require user interaction and decision to transform and reshape the raw data (which is still easier than doing _copy-paste and transpose_ in excel) into the tidy format. 

However, consider the situations like, you are given a pile of excel (or any other format of spreadsheets) which are somehow similar but are generated by various human hands over a long period (obviously the format and structure will change from file to file). Or you want to build an automated forecast mechanism based on some spreadsheet which updates periodically (possibly you may get the updated file through some automated channel like web scraping, FTP transfer etc.). Or simply you want something like _"I'm Feeling Lucky!"_


## Installation
To install the development version from GitHub you'll need `devtools` package in R.
Assuming you have `devtools` you can install this package in R with the following command:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-rudra/tidycells")
```

To start with `tidycells`, I invite you to see `vignette("tidycells-intro")`.

## Quick Overview

Let's take a quick look at an example data as given in 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE)
```

The data looks like (in excel)

```{r, out.width = "451px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/marks.png")
```

Let's try our luck in this data

Read at once
```{r, eval=FALSE}
system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
  read_cells()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(rlang::is_installed("tidyxl")){
  system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
    read_cells() %>% 
    knitr::kable()
}
```


The fucntion `read_cells` is a set of ordered operations connected together. The flowchart of `read_cells`:

```{r, out.width = "356px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/read_cells.png")
```

Let's understand step by step procedures followed by `read_cells`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if you have tidyxl installed
d <- system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
  read_cells(at_level = "make_cells") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```
```{r}
# or you may do
d <- system.file("extdata", "marks_cells.rds", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
  readRDS()
```
```{r}
d <- numeric_values_classifier(d)
da <- analyze_cells(d)
```

Then you need to run `compose_cells` with additional new argument `print_attribute_overview = TRUE`

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dc <- compose_cells(da, print_attribute_overview = TRUE)
```
```{r, out.width = "451px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/compose_cells_cli1.png")
dc <- compose_cells(da)
```

```{r}
# bit tricky and tedious unless you do print_attribute_overview = TRUE in above line
dcfine <- dc %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(name = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ major_row_left_2_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ major_col_bottom_1_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ major_row_left_1_1
  ),
  sex = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ major_row_left_1_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ major_col_bottom_2_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ minor_row_right_1_1
  ),
  school = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ minor_col_top_1_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ minor_corner_topLeft_1_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ minor_col_top_1_1
  )) %>% 
  dplyr::select(school,sex, name, value)

```

`head(dcfine)` looks like
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(dcfine), align = c(rep("l", 3), "c"))
```

This is still not good right! You had to manually pick some weird column-names and spent some brain (when it was evident from data which columns should be aligned with whom). 

The `collate_columns` functions does exactly this for you. So instead of manually picking column-names after compose cells you can simply run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# collate_columns(dc) should be same with 
# direct read_cells() result except table_tag column
collate_columns(dc) %>% 
  head()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(collate_columns(dc)), align = c(rep("l", 4), "c"))
```

Looks like staged example! Yes you are right this is not always perfect (same is true for `analyze_cells` also). However, if the data is somehow helpful in demystifying underlying columns structure (like this one), then this will be useful. 

These functions `read_cells` (all functionalities combined), `analyze_cells`, `collate_columns` are here to ease your pain in data wrangling and reading from various sources. It may not be full-proof solution to all types of tabular data. It is always recommended to perform these tasks manually whenever expected results are not coming. 


### Plots and Interactive Modules
The package provides `ggplot` based plots and `shiny` based interactive visualisations for understanding how the heuristic is functioning and also provides object (like `cell-df` or `cell-analysis`) editing capabilities. 

The [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package is required for interactive modules. Most of the features are self-explanatory and guided. 

Check out interactive documentation of any of these functions listed below. All of these functions are available as [RStudio Addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/).

Here are screenshots of each interactive widgets. 

1. Plot tune (part of all modules)
2. `visual_crop()` for data crop and deletion of sections

```{r, out.width = "516px", echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/v12.png")
```

3. `visual_va_classify()` for interactive VA classification
4. `visual_data_block_inspection()` this shows how the heuristic has performed the analysis after `analyze_cells`

```{r, out.width = "516px", echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/v34.png")
```

5. `visual_orientation_modification()` for modification to heuristic based results
6. `visual_traceback()` this is for observing how the original data is composed to form the final output. (`compose_cells` is called internally)

```{r, out.width = "516px", echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/ext/v56.png")
```

For each of these modules, there is a dynamic plot option available from [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly). If you have that package, the corresponding tab will be activated. 
Since all of these modules are entirely optional the dependency is kept at **tidycells** 'suggests' level only. 


## Reference and Related Projects
* [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) :  **Read Untidy Excel Files:**
Imports non-tabular from Excel files into R. Exposes cell content, position and formatting in a tidy structure for further manipulation. Tokenizes Excel formulas. Supports '.xlsx' and '.xlsm' via the embedded 'RapidXML' C++ library <http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net>. Does not support '.xlsb' or '.xls'.
* [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr): **Unpivot Complex and Irregular Data Layouts**
Tools for converting data from complex or irregular layouts to a columnar structure. For example, tables with multilevel column or row headers, or spreadsheets. Header and data cells are selected by their contents and position, as well as formatting and comments where available, and are associated with one other by their proximity in given directions. Functions for data frames and HTML tables are provided.
Major parts of the package right now fully depend on **unpivotr**. The **tidycells** package would have never existed without this wonderful package from [Duncan Garmonsway](https://github.com/nacnudus).
* The [rsheets](https://github.com/rsheets) project: 
It hosts several R packages (few of them are in CRAN already) which are in the early stages of importing spreadsheets from Excel and Google Sheets into R.  Specifically, have a look at these projects which seems closely related to these projects : [jailbreaker](https://github.com/rsheets/jailbreakr), [rexcel](https://github.com/rsheets/rexcel) (README of this project has a wonderful reference for excel integration with R).
* The [tidyABS](https://github.com/ianmoran11/tidyABS) package: 
The `tidyABS` package converts ABS excel tables to tidy data frames. It uses rules-of-thumb to determine the structure of excel tables, however it sometimes requires pointers from the user. This package is in early development.


## Acknowledgement
This package incomplete without following packages (apart from the **unpivotr** which is the core package on which **tidycells** depends largely, as mentioned above ). Each of these packages are in suggests fields of `tidycells`.
(The read_cells basically, performs unification on several functions from various packages to give you support for different file types. These are listed below.)

* [**readr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readr): for csv (in melted format)
* [**readxl**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl): for reading xls (if xlsx is present by default xlsx will be used for xls)
* [**xlsx**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xlsx): for reading xls (also it has capabilities to read xlsx)
* [**tidyxl**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyxl): really fast library for reading xlsx
* [**docxtractr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=docxtractr) : for docx and doc (it has a system level dependency now)
* [**tabulizer**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tabulizer) : for pdf
