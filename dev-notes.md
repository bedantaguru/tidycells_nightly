### FAQs

##### 1) **Why there are two code coverages?**

The package contains optional functionality which are written as shiny widgets. These are given to the user as [`visual_*`](https://github.com/r-rudra/tidycells/blob/master/R/visual_functions.R) series of functions. Limited [tests](https://github.com/r-rudra/tidycells/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-shiny.R) for these are developed and tested in a few testing environments. These tests are based on [shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/) package. The [covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) package is not yet (at least the **CRAN** version) capable to track code coverages in shinytest [Ref: r-lib/covr [#277](https://github.com/r-lib/covr/issues/277)]. Also note that shinytest is not yet taking widget-based functions [Ref: rstudio/shinytest [#157](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest/issues/157)] (at least the **CRAN** version). That is why a set of [functions](https://github.com/r-rudra/tidycells/blob/master/tests/testthat/testlib/shiny_test.R) is introduced to run tests for shiny. 

On these grounds, codecov [![Codecov test
coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/r-rudra/tidycells/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/r-rudra/tidycells?branch=master) is used to give full coverage (_without any restiction_) (_ideally this should increase provided the support for covr is introduced in shinytest and covr both_). While the coveralls [![Coveralls test
coverage](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/r-rudra/tidycells/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/r-rudra/tidycells?branch=master) shows the coverage excluding `shiny_*.R` and `visual_*.R` files (_showing the coverage for only main functionality_)


### Current State of Development and Way Forward

  - [x] Test it in [r-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/)
  - [x] Test for optional shiny modules (series of `visual_*` functions)
  - [ ] Write more tests (increase coverage)
  - [ ] Write more vignettes on other topics
  - [ ] Releasing this package to CRAN
  - [ ] Making a pkgdown site
  - [ ] Making cell analysis little faster
  

### R-hub other builds

See other successful builds in [CRAN Comments](https://github.com/r-rudra/tidycells/blob/master/cran-comments.md)

#### Minor Issues

* Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit
  * R-patched

**Result** : WARNING

**Reason** : Pandoc issues in re-building vignettes

* Fedora Linux, 
  * R-devel, clang, gfortran
  * R-devel, GCC

**Result** : NOTE

**Reason** : Packages suggested but not available for checking: 'tabulizer', 'xlsx'

* CentOS 6
  * stock R from EPEL

**Result** : NOTE

**Reason** : Packages suggested but not available for checking: ‘tidyxl’ ‘plotly’

####  Errors

* Debian Linux, 
  * R-devel, clang, ISO-8859-15 locale
  * R-devel, GCC
  * R-devel, GCC, no long double
  * R-patched, GCC
  * R-release, GCC
  * R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN
* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS
  * R-devel, GCC
  * R-release, GCC
  * R-devel with rchk

**Result** : PREPERROR

**Reason** : xml2 and httr failed to installed due to system dependency (libxml2, libssl/openssl)


**Note** : Neither of these errors (or notes) are attributable to package as they failed because of induced system dependency or optional package dependency.


### Dependency Explained

Note the package has "Induced System Dependency" which is causing to break the code sometime in [R-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/). Below table describes the same.
